# Write a file to stdout
Source: https://bun.com/docs/guides/write-file/cat


Bun exposes `stdout` as a `BunFile` with the `Bun.stdout` property. Pass it as the destination to [`Bun.write()`](/docs/runtime/file-io#writing-files-bun-write).

The following code writes a file to `stdout`, like the Unix `cat` command.

**File:** `cat.ts`
```ts
const path = "/path/to/file.txt";
const file = Bun.file(path);
await Bun.write(Bun.stdout, file);
```
