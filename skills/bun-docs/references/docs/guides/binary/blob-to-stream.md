# Convert a Blob to a ReadableStream
Source: https://bun.com/docs/guides/binary/blob-to-stream


The [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) class provides several methods for consuming its contents in different formats, including `.stream()`, which returns a `ReadableStream`.

```ts
const blob = new Blob(["hello world"]);
const stream = blob.stream();
```
